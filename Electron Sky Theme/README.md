*(See Electron Theme folder for a general description)*

Electron Sky is a brighter version of the Electron theme, featuring the same design as the original theme and an adjusted color scheme favoring brighter colors. Like Electron, Sky is the results of many experiments and tests. The design was tweaked to fit the bright setting. 

Electron Sky needs to be installed to be fully appreciated :)

## Installation

Simply copy the Electron Sky folder into `ux0:/VitaShell/theme/` and make sure to modify `theme.txt` (in the former directory) to point to the new theme. This is done by changing `THEME_NAME = "Old_theme"` to `THEME_NAME = "Electron Sky"`

Thanks for stopping by and Enjoy :)
