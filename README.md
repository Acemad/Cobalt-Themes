This is my entry to theFlow's VitaShell default theme contest. [Link](http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=47830&sid=8b890dbb3668cc097cb76f8f8ed849c8)

It's a fairly simple and clean theme with a predominant blue color, nondistractingly influenced by circuit boards with a touch of PlayStation. Highly consistent in every part of VitaShell.
Features redesigned file browser icons and new backgrounds for file browser, text editor, hex editor, image viewer and music player, plus a prettier context menu and much more subtle changes and refinements.

Currently, It has two versions. The original theme (Cobalt), and a darker variation (Cobalt Dark).
