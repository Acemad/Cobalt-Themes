# Acemad's VitaShell Themes Collection
## An assortment of original VitaShell themes.

(Originaly designed for theFlow's VitaShell default theme contest. [Link](http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=47830&sid=8b890dbb3668cc097cb76f8f8ed849c8))

I believe any theme design should follow these principles to be considered usable, mainly :

- A theme must be unobtrusive.
- A theme should be as clean as possible.
- A theme's color scheme should be easy on the eyes.
- Contrast variations should be clearly justified.
- A theme must be consistent across the differnt views/component.
- If a theme is based on a certain franchise/idea, graphics should be subtle and unobtrusive.

In my attemp to fulfill (more or less of) the above rules, I came up with the following themes :

## Cobalt

A fairly simple and clean theme with a predominant blue color, nondistractingly influenced by circuit boards with a touch of PlayStation. Highly consistent in every part of VitaShell.
Features redesigned file browser icons and new backgrounds for file browser, text editor, hex editor, image viewer and music player, plus a prettier context menu and much more subtle changes and refinements.

## Cobalt Dark

A darker veriosn of Cobalt theme, with some subtle tweaks and modifications. features nearly identical design with a darker color scheme.

## Electron
