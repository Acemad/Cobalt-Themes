# Cobalt
## A VitaShell Theme

![image](CobaltLogoS.png)

*(Yeah, it has a logo)*

This is my entry to theFlow's VitaShell default theme contest. [Link](http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=47830&sid=8b890dbb3668cc097cb76f8f8ed849c8)

It's a fairly simple and clean theme with a predominant blue color, nondistractingly influenced by circuit boards with a touch of PlayStation. Highly consitent in every part of VitaShell.
Features redesigned file browser icons and New backgrounds for file browser, text editor, hex editor, image viewer and music player, plus a prettier context menu and much more subtle changes and refinments.

## Installation

Simply copy the Cobalt folder into `ux0:/VitaShell/theme/` and make sure to modify `theme.txt` (in the former directory) to point to the new theme. This is done by changing `THEME_NAME = "Old_theme"` to `THEME_NAME = "Cobalt"`

Thanks for stopping by and Enjoy :)
